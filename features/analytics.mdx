## Usage Analytics

### API Gateway Metrics

Track all AI requests through RegPilot Gateway:

- **Total Requests**: Requests per day/week/month
- **Tokens Used**: Input and output tokens
- **Model Distribution**: Usage by AI model (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Response Times**: Average, P50, P95, P99 latency
- **Success Rates**: Successful vs failed requests
- **Error Types**: Breakdown of error causes

### Cost Tracking

Monitor AI spending:

```typescript
{
  "period": "2024-01",
  "total_cost": 1247.32,
  "breakdown": {
    "gpt-4": 892.15,
    "gpt-3.5-turbo": 245.87,
    "claude-3-opus": 109.30
  },
  "budget": 2000.00,
  "usage_percent": 62.4
}
```

## Compliance Analytics

### Compliance Trends

View compliance score changes over time:

- Daily/weekly/monthly compliance scores
- Violations by type and severity
- Framework-specific compliance (EU AI Act, GDPR)
- Resolution rates and times

### Bias Detection

Advanced fairness metrics:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Demographic Parity" icon="users">
    Measures whether predictions are independent of protected attributes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Equal Opportunity" icon="balance-scale">
    Checks if true positive rates are equal across groups
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Calibration" icon="crosshairs">
    Ensures predicted probabilities match actual outcomes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Individual Fairness" icon="user-check">
    Similar individuals receive similar predictions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Analytics

### Response Time Distribution

Monitor AI response performance:

- P50 (median): Typical response time
- P95: 95% of requests faster than this
- P99: 99% of requests faster than this
- Max response time
- Timeout rate

### Model Performance

Track model accuracy and reliability:

- Success rate by model
- Error rates and types
- Retry patterns
- Governor validation rates

## Custom Reports

Create custom analytics reports:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Metrics">
    Choose which data points to include
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Filters">
    Filter by project, model, date range, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Visualization">
    Select chart types (line, bar, pie, table)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule & Export">
    Email reports or export as PDF/CSV
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Access

Access analytics programmatically:

```typescript
// Get usage analytics
const usage = await regpilot.analytics.usage({
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31',
  groupBy: 'day'
});

// Get compliance trends
const compliance = await regpilot.analytics.compliance({
  framework: 'eu_ai_act',
  period: 'last_30_days'
});

// Get cost breakdown
const costs = await regpilot.analytics.costs({
  currency: 'USD',
  groupBy: 'model'
});
```

## Alerts & Notifications

Set up analytics-based alerts:

- Budget threshold exceeded
- Unusual usage patterns
- Performance degradation
- Compliance score drops
- High error rates
