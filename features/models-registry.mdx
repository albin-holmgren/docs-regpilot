## AI Models Registry

The Models Registry is your centralized hub for managing all AI models used in your applications, including risk classification, compliance status, and performance monitoring.

## Why Register Models?

  <Card title="Risk Classification" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Automatically classify models by risk level

## Risk Classifications

Models are classified according to EU AI Act risk levels:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unacceptable Risk">
    **Prohibited** - Cannot be deployed
    - Social scoring systems
    - Subliminal manipulation
    - Exploitation of vulnerabilities
    - Real-time biometric identification (with exceptions)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="High Risk">
    **Strict requirements** - Full compliance needed
    - Employment decisions
    - Credit scoring
    - Educational admissions
    - Law enforcement
    - Critical infrastructure
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Limited Risk">
    **Transparency obligations** - Disclosure required
    - Chatbots
    - Emotion recognition
    - Biometric categorization
    - Deepfake generation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Minimal Risk">
    **No specific obligations**
    - Spam filters
    - Video game AI
    - Inventory management
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Registering a Model

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic Information">
    ```typescript
    const model = await regpilot.models.register({
      name: "Customer Support Classifier",
      version: "1.0.0",
      provider: "openai",
      model_id: "gpt-4-turbo",
      description: "Classifies customer support tickets"
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Risk Classification">
    Select the appropriate risk level based on intended use:
    ```typescript
    await regpilot.models.update(model.id, {
      risk_level: "limited",
      intended_purpose: "Customer support automation",
      target_users: "Customer service representatives"
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Technical Documentation">
    Upload required documentation:
    - System architecture
    - Training data description
    - Performance metrics
    - Risk assessment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compliance Settings">
    Configure compliance monitoring:
    ```typescript
    await regpilot.models.setCompliance(model.id, {
      frameworks: ["eu_ai_act", "gdpr"],
      monitoring_enabled: true,
      governor_enabled: true
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Model Information

Each registered model includes:

### Basic Details
- Name and version
- Provider and model ID
- Description and purpose
- Deployment environment

### Risk Assessment
- Risk classification
- Intended purpose
- Target user groups
- Potential risks identified

### Technical Documentation
- Model architecture
- Training data sources
- Performance metrics
- Validation results
- Bias testing results

### Compliance Status
- Applicable frameworks
- Compliance score
- Active violations
- Last assessment date

## Managing Models

### Update Model

```typescript
await regpilot.models.update("model_123", {
  version: "1.1.0",
  status: "production",
  performance_metrics: {
    accuracy: 0.94,
    f1_score: 0.92,
    latency_p95: 250
  }
});
```

### Archive Model

```typescript
await regpilot.models.archive("model_123", {
  reason: "Replaced by v2.0",
  replacement_model_id: "model_456"
});
```

### Generate Documentation

```typescript
const docs = await regpilot.models.generateDocs("model_123", {
  format: "pdf",
  include_sections: [
    "technical_specs",
    "risk_assessment",
    "compliance_status",
    "performance_metrics"
  ]
});
```

## Model Monitoring

Continuous monitoring includes:

- **Performance Tracking**: Accuracy, latency, error rates
- **Compliance Validation**: Ongoing EU AI Act checks
- **Bias Detection**: Regular fairness assessments
- **Usage Analytics**: Request volumes and patterns
- **Incident Tracking**: Errors and violations

## Compliance Requirements

For **high-risk models**, you must maintain:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Technical Documentation" icon="file">
    - Detailed system description
    - Development and testing procedures
    - Risk management documentation
    - Data governance records
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk Management System" icon="shield">
    - Identified risks and mitigations
    - Residual risk evaluation
    - Testing and validation results
    - Ongoing monitoring procedures
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Governance" icon="database">
    - Training data description
    - Data quality metrics
    - Bias assessments
    - Data provenance records
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Human Oversight" icon="user">
    - Oversight measures
    - Stop/override capabilities
    - Human-in-the-loop procedures
    - Responsibility assignment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register Early">
    Register models during development, not just at deployment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Version Control">
    Track all model versions with detailed change logs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Regular Updates">
    Keep documentation and compliance status current
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Continuously">
    Enable ongoing performance and compliance monitoring
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Changes">
    Record all updates, incidents, and modifications
  </Step>
</Steps>
